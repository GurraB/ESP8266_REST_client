# solar-measurement
A project with the esp8266 that sends values from a solar panel to a server to study the solar conditions.

This project uses an ESP8266-01 and the ESP8266 Non-OS SDK v1.2.0

Current status:
I currently have no access to any solar panels due to an error when ordering them from eBay. This project is on hold.
